                Dear Dr.<br /><br />
                ProGen Biologics manufacture and sell a unique line of ELISA kits to measure humoral and innate immune responses based on the capture of circulating immune complexes (CICs) by a receptor “Proceptor”. The capture of immune complexes on the solid phase allows us to measure the activated complement fragments bound to CICs. These assays are sensitive and are protein quantities are not influenced by metabolic differences in plasma complement synthesis. Proceptor ELISA kits provide a useful and novel approach to measure complement activation.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ELISA kits for measuring complement proteins C1q, C3, C4, C5, C3d, C4d and C5b-9 bound to ICs in serum or plasma.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELISA kits to measure Clusterin and Vitronectin bound to soluble MAC as well as ICs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELISA kits to measure immune complexes composed of various isotypes e.g. IgG, IgA and IgM.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELISA kits to measure kappa (k) and lambda (λ) light chains. Proceptor kits provide unique tools for studying BCR editing.

                    <li>
                        Company also provides services for the purification of ICs from serum or plasma samples from as little as 1 to 2 ml of sample. We will support antigen identification using 2D SDS-PAGE that can be coupled to nano-LC/MS/MS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also support quantification of Fc receptor expressing cell populations in the PBMCs of both human and mice.
